## Data Preprocessing and Exploration
-  Load the dataset and perform basic exploratory data analysis.
-  Check for and handle any missing values.
-  Visualize the data to understand the relationships between the features.
-  Create any additional features you think would be useful for predicting energy consumption.

## Model Building
-  Split the data into training and testing sets.
-  Train at least two different machine learning models to predict energy consumption (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
-  Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Model Selection and Justification
-  Select the best-performing model.
